# Ebean Entities

Ebean entities are POJOs annotated with `jakarta.persistence.*` and optionally
`io.ebean.annotation.*`. They support lazy loading, dirty checking, and
automatic auditing.

## Concepts

- **`@Entity` + `@Table`** — mark a class as a persistent entity
- **`@Id` + `@GeneratedValue`** — identity column (auto-increment in SQLite)
- **`@ManyToOne` / `@OneToMany`** — relationships with lazy loading by default
- **`@WhenCreated` / `@WhenModified`** — automatic timestamp auditing
- **`@SoftDelete`** — sets a flag instead of deleting the row
- **`@DbEnumType`** — stores enums as strings or integers
- **`@Index`** — adds database indexes via DDL generation

## Rules

1. Keep entities as plain classes (not records) — Ebean needs setters/field access.
2. Use `@Version` for optimistic locking on concurrent-write entities.
3. Always define `equals()`/`hashCode()` based on the business key or `@Id`.
4. Use `@SoftDelete` instead of physical deletes when data retention matters.
5. Annotate `@ManyToOne` with `@JoinColumn(name = "foreign_key_col")`.
6. Use `@DbEnumType(ENUM)` for string-stored enums — more readable than ordinals.
7. Keep `FetchType.LAZY` as default; use `EAGER` only when always needed.

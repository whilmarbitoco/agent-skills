# Native Installers

Beyond basic `jpackage`, each platform has specific customizations:
license files, desktop shortcuts, file associations, signing, and
post-install hooks. POS apps need branded installers that configure
the POS terminal on first launch.

## Concepts

- **`.wix` / WiX** — Windows MSI custom actions (service install, file
  associations).
- **`dpkg-deb` / `debhelper`** — Linux `.deb` maintainer scripts
  (`postinst`, `prerm`).
- **`pkgbuild` / `productbuild`** — macOS `.pkg` and `.dmg` creation.
- **Code signing** — Authenticode (Windows), GPG/notarize (macOS),
  GPG (Linux) to avoid OS warning dialogs.

## Rules

1. Bundle a JRE via `jlink` runtime image — never depend on system JRE
   in native installers.
2. Include `postinst` on Linux to create symlink in `/usr/local/bin` and
   register `.desktop` file.
3. Sign Windows MSIs with Authenticode or users see "Unknown publisher".
4. Store installer version in the filename: `pos-installer-1.0.0.msi`.
5. Test install, upgrade, and uninstall on each target OS in CI.
